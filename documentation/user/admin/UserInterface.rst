Languages
.........
In this section you could enable all the languages required by your project and configure the default language.

.. note::
   Thanks to the `Localization Lab <https://www.localizationlab.org/>`_ and our great voluneer comminity, the software is already available and continously made available in a lot of languages. This aspect of internationalization is crucial in many projects. In case you are starting a project and the required languages are not available we strongly invite you to register on our `web translation platform <https://www.transifex.com/otf/globaleaks/>`_ offered by `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/otf/globaleaks/>`_ and support yourself the translation. Internationalization and Localization is in fact are crucial for the success of a whistleblowing project. Thank you!

Text Customization
..................
Here could be confiured overrides for any of the texts of the platform and of their translation.

Users
-----
This sections is where users could be created and managed.
The system with the basic configuration completed with the initial Platform wizard is configured with an Administrator and a Recipient.

Depending on your project needs here you could create users with different roles and manage their respective privileges.

.. image:: ../../images/admin/users.png

User Roles
..........
The software offers the possibility to create users with the following roles:

   1. Administrators

   2. Recipients

Administrators

Questionnaires
--------------
This section is where whistleblowing questionnaires could be created and managed.

By default the software implements a Default Questionnaire with a single Step and the following three questions:

   One question "Short description" of type "Multi-line text input" enabling whistleblower to provide a short summary of the fact reported;

   One question "Full description" of type "Multi-line text input" enabling whistleblowers to describe the fact reported in detail;

   One question "Attachments" of type "Attachment" enabling users to load one or more attachments.

The system with its basic configuration completed with the initial Platform wizard is also already configured with this Default Questionnaire pre-associated to the Default Context.

Depending on your project needs you could create specific questionnaire for each of your different reports' contexts.

.. image:: ../../images/admin/questionnaires.png

Depending on your project needs you may evaluate defining some questions once as Question Templates and reuse the same question in multiple questionnaires.

.. image:: ../../images/admin/question-templates.png

Steps
.....
The software enables to organise questionnaire in one or multiple steps.
For example the default qeustionnaire is organized with a single step including all the questions.

Questions Types

The software enables you to create questions of the following types:

   1. Single-line text input

   2. Multi-line text input

   3. Selection box

   4. Multiple choice input

   5. Checkbox

   6. Attachment

   7. Terms of service

   8. Date

   9. Date range

   10. Map

   11. Question group

General Question Properties

Contexts
--------
This section is where whistleblowing contexts (channels) could be created and managed.

A whistleblowing channel is typically defined by the following main characteristics

    Name: the name of the channel
    Image: an image to identify the channel
    Description: a description of the channel
    Recipients: the set of recipients that will receive reports sent to this channel
    Questionnaire: the questionnaire that will be proposed to whistlelowers selecting this channel
    Submission expiration: the data retention policy for the channel

The system with the basic configuration completed with the initial platform wizard is configured with a single Context called Default, on which is associated a recipient and the default questionnaire.

Depending on your project needs here you could create additional Contexts and configure their respective recipients and properties.

.. image:: ../../images/admin/contexts.png

Submissions Expiration
......................
The software enables to configure a data retention policy for each channel.
This is a fundamental property of the whistleblowing channel that makes it possible to configure automatic secure deletion of reports after a certain period of time.
This setting should be configured in relation to the risk of the channel in order to limit unndeded exposure of the reportss received therein.

By default a context is configured with a report expiration of 30 days.

Case Management
---------------
This section is intended to host all the main case management feature that will be offered by the software.
Currently it hosts the possibility to define reports statuses and substatuses intended to be used by Recipients while working on the reports.

By default the system includes the following report statuses:

   1. New

   2. Open

   3. Closed

Within this section you may add additional Statuses between the State Open and Closed and you can furtherly define Substatuses for the Closed status (e.g. Archived / Spam)
