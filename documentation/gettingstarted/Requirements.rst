Requirements
============
Make sure you understand and satisfy each of the following technical requirements.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------
**Requirements**:

- CPU: Dual core 2.0GHz
- RAM: 1GB
- STORAGE: 20GB
- I/O: 10Mbit/s (shared)

Please note that GlobaLeaks is designed to run on servers even smaller than the above configuration.

The storage size should be defined based on your data retention policies and the expected use of the platform.

Software Requirements
---------------------
GlobaLeaks is designed to run on GNU/Linux and developed and tested specifically for Debian based systems.

The software lifecycle of the platform includes full support for all Debian and Ubuntu LTS versions starting from `Debian 10 <https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/>`_ and `Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_.

On these platforms the support is guaranteed following the official long term support timelines:

- `Release End of Life Timeline <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>`_ defined by Debian;
- `Release End of Life Timeline <https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life>`_ defined by Ubuntu.

Support for more distributions is planned.
